/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link Lock} with the same basic
 * behavior and semantics as the implicit monitor lock accessed using
 * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended
 * capabilities.
 * 可重入的互斥 Lock，具有与使用 synchronized 相同的方法和语句访问的
 * 隐式监视器锁相同的基本行为和语义，但它比 synchronized 具有更多可扩展功能。
 *
 * <p>A {@code ReentrantLock} is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
 * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
 * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
 * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
 * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
 * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
 * #getHoldCount}.
 * ReentrantLock 由上次成功锁定但是未解锁的线程拥有。一个线程调用 lock 方法会立刻
 * 返回并成功获取锁，当这把锁没有被其他线程拥有时。如果当前线程已经拥有这把锁，这个方法
 * 会立刻返回。可以使用方法 isHeldByCurrentThread 和 getHoldCount 进行检查。
 *
 * <p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
 * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
 * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
 * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
 * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
 * variances in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
 * starvation. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
 * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
 * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
 * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
 * lock.
 * 这个类的构造函数接受可选择的 fairness 参数，当 fairness 设置为 true 时，
 * 在多线程争夺尝试加锁时，锁倾向于对等待时间最长的线程访问，这也是公平性的一种体现。
 * 否则，锁不能保证每个线程的访问顺序，也就是非公平锁。与使用默认设置的程序相比，
 * 使用许多线程访问的公平锁的程序可能会显示较低的总体吞吐量（即较慢；通常要慢得多）。
 * 但是获取锁并保证线程不会饥饿的次数比较小。无论如何请注意：锁的公平性不能保证线程调度的
 * 公平性。因此，使用公平锁的许多线程之一可能会连续多次获得它，而其他活动线程没有进行且当前未持有该锁。
 *
 *
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock()} method does not
 * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 * is available even if other threads are waiting.
 * 也要注意不定时的 tryLock() 方法不支持公平性设置。如果锁是可以获取的，那么即使
 * 其他线程等待，它仍然能够返回成功。
 *
 * <p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
 * follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
 * typically in a before/after construction such as:
 *
 *
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link Lock} interface, this
 * class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
 * methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
 * methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
 * 另外为了实现 Lock 接口，这个类定义了一些 public 和 protected 的方法来检查锁的状态
 * 一些方法仅仅对管程管用
 *
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive locks by
 * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
 * 该锁通过同一线程最多支持2147483647个递归锁。 尝试超过此限制会导致锁定方法引发{@link Error}。
