/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} that can schedule commands to run after a given
 * delay, or to execute periodically.
 * 可以安排命令在给定的延迟后运行或者定期执行。
 *
 * <p>The {@code schedule} methods create tasks with various delays
 * and return a task object that can be used to cancel or check
 * execution. The {@code scheduleAtFixedRate} and
 * {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay} methods create and execute tasks
 * that run periodically until cancelled.
 * schedule 方法创建了一个不同延迟时间的任务，并且返回一个能够取消或者检查执行情况的任务对象。
 * scheduleAtFixedRate 和 scheduleWithFixedDelay 方法创建并执行一个定期运行直到取消
 * 的任务。
 *
 * <p>Commands submitted using the {@link Executor#execute(Runnable)}
 * and {@link ExecutorService} {@code submit} methods are scheduled
 * with a requested delay of zero. Zero and negative delays (but not
 * periods) are also allowed in {@code schedule} methods, and are
 * treated as requests for immediate execution.
 * 使用 Executor.execute 和 ExecutorService.submit 方法提交的命令没有延迟。
 * schedule 还允许零延迟和负延迟，这些都被视为立即执行的请求。
 *
 * <p>All {@code schedule} methods accept <em>relative</em> delays and
 * periods as arguments, not absolute times or dates. It is a simple
 * matter to transform an absolute time represented as a {@link
 * java.util.Date} to the required form. For example, to schedule at
 * a certain future {@code date}, you can use: {@code schedule(task,
 * date.getTime() - System.currentTimeMillis(),
 * TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)}. Beware however that expiration of a
 * relative delay need not coincide with the current {@code Date} at
 * which the task is enabled due to network time synchronization
 * protocols, clock drift, or other factors.
 * 所有的 schedule 方法都接收相对的延迟和周期作为参数，而不是绝对的时间和周期。将绝对时间
 * 转换为相对时间很简单，你可以使用 schedule(task,date.getTime() - System.currentTimeMillis()
 * TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)。
 *
 * <p>The {@link Executors} class provides convenient factory methods for
 * the ScheduledExecutorService implementations provided in this package.
 * Executors 类提供了方便的工厂方法来为 ScheduledExecutorService 创建实现类。
 *
 * <h3>Usage Example</h3>
 *
 * Here is a class with a method that sets up a ScheduledExecutorService
 * to beep every ten seconds for an hour:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * import static java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.*;
 * class BeeperControl {
 *   private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
 *     Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);
 *
 *   public void beepForAnHour() {
 *     final Runnable beeper = new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() { System.out.println("beep"); }
 *     };
 *     final ScheduledFuture<?> beeperHandle =
 *       scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS);
 *     scheduler.schedule(new Runnable() {
 *       public void run() { beeperHandle.cancel(true); }
 *     }, 60 * 60, SECONDS);
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
