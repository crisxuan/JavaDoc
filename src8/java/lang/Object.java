     *     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
     *     used in {@code equals} comparisons on the object is modified.
     *     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     *     application to another execution of the same application.
     *     无论每次、何时在运行 Java 程序执行期间调用同一个对象，这个 hashCode 方法都必须
     *     一致性的返回同一个 integer 值，前提是在 equals 的比较中没有被修改。
     *     在一个应用程序与另一个程序的执行过程中，执行 hashCode 方法所返回的值可以不一致。
     *
     *
     * <li>If two objects are equal according to the {@code equals(Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of
     *     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
     *     如果两个对象根据 equals(Object) 比较相等，然后调用两个对象上各自的 hashCode 方法
     *     必须得到相同integer 结果。
     *
     * <li>It is <em>not</em> required that if two objects are unequal
     *     according to the {@link java.lang.Object#equals(java.lang.Object)}
     *     method, then calling the {@code hashCode} method on each of the

     * </ul>
     * 必须意识到一个问题，那就是如果两个对象不相等，那么调用 hashcode 方法必须返回
     * 不同的结果，为不同对象生成不同的 hashcode 会提高哈希表的性能。

     * <p>
     * As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by

     *     自反性：对于任何非空引用来说的值 x 来说，x.equals(x) 应该返回 true。
     *
     * <li>It is <i>symmetric</i>: for any non-null reference values
     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, {@code x.equals(y)}
     *     should return {@code true} if and only if
     *     {@code y.equals(x)} returns {@code true}.
     *      对称性：对于任何非空引用的值 x 和 y来说，x.equals(y) 返回true的条件是

     *     {@code x.equals(y)} returns {@code true} and

     *      如果x.equals(y) 返回true，y.equals(z) 返回true，
     *      那么x.equals(z) 也应该返回true。

     *     {@code x} and {@code y}, multiple invocations of
     *     {@code x.equals(y)} consistently return {@code true}
     *     or consistently return {@code false}, provided no

     *     objects is modified.
     *     一致性：对于任何非空引用x,y来说，如果两个对象相等，它们就必须保证始终相等，
     *     除非它们中有一个对象(或者两个都)被修改了。
     *     也就是说，可变对象在不同的时候可以与不同的对象相等。不可变对象不会这样，它们会保证始终相等。

     * 虽然情况确实如此， x.clone().equals(x) 将返回true，这不是绝对需要的。
     *
     * <p>
     * By convention, the returned object should be obtained by calling
     * {@code super.clone}.  If a class and all of its superclasses (except

     * By convention, the object returned by this method should be independent
     * of this object (which is being cloned).  To achieve this independence,
     * it may be necessary to modify one or more fields of the object returned
     * by {@code super.clone} before returning it.  Typically, this means
     * copying any mutable objects that comprise the internal "deep structure"
     * of the object being cloned and replacing the references to these
     * objects with references to the copies.  If a class contains only
     * primitive fields or references to immutable objects, then it is usually
     * the case that no fields in the object returned by {@code super.clone}
     * need to be modified.
     * 按照惯例，此方法返回的对象应独立于此对象（正在克隆）。要实现此独立性，
     * 可能需要在返回之前修改 super.clone() 返回的对象的一个或多个字段。
     * 通常，这意味着复制包含被克隆对象的内部“深层结构”的任何可变对象，
     * 并使用对副本的引用替换对这些对象的引用。

     * the return type of the {@code clone} method of an array type {@code T[]}
     * is {@code T[]} where T is any reference or primitive type.
     * Otherwise, this method creates a new instance of the class of this
     * object and initializes all its fields with exactly the contents of
     * the corresponding fields of this object, as if by assignment; the
     * contents of the fields are not themselves cloned. Thus, this method

     * ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
     * method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
     * invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the

     * <p>
     * This method is similar to the {@code wait} method of one

     * <li>The timeout period, specified by {@code timeout}
     *     milliseconds plus {@code nanos} nanoseconds arguments, has
     *     elapsed.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The thread then waits until it can re-obtain ownership of the
     * monitor and resumes execution.
     * <p>
     * As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are
     * possible, and this method should always be used in a loop:
     * <pre>

     *     }
     * </pre>
     * This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
     * of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
     * description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
     * a monitor.

     * A subclass overrides the {@code finalize} method to dispose of
     * system resources or to perform other cleanup.
     * <p>
     * The general contract of {@code finalize} is that it is invoked
     * if and when the Java&trade; virtual
     * machine has determined that there is no longer any
     * means by which this object can be accessed by any thread that has
     * not yet died, except as a result of an action taken by the

     * finalized. The {@code finalize} method may take any action, including
     * making this object available again to other threads; the usual purpose
     * of {@code finalize}, however, is to perform cleanup actions before
     * the object is irrevocably discarded. For example, the finalize method
     * for an object that represents an input/output connection might perform
     * explicit I/O transactions to break the connection before the object is
     * permanently discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method of class {@code Object} performs no
     * special action; it simply returns normally. Subclasses of
     * {@code Object} may override this definition.
     * <p>
     * The Java programming language does not guarantee which thread will
     * invoke the {@code finalize} method for any given object. It is
     * guaranteed, however, that the thread that invokes finalize will not
     * be holding any user-visible synchronization locks when finalize is
     * invoked. If an uncaught exception is thrown by the finalize method,
     * the exception is ignored and finalization of that object terminates.
     * <p>
     * After the {@code finalize} method has been invoked for an object, no
     * further action is taken until the Java virtual machine has again
     * determined that there is no longer any means by which this object can
     * be accessed by any thread that has not yet died, including possible
     * actions by other objects or classes which are ready to be finalized,
     * at which point the object may be discarded.
     * <p>
     * The {@code finalize} method is never invoked more than once by a Java
     * virtual machine for any given object.
     * <p>
     * Any exception thrown by the {@code finalize} method causes
     * the finalization of this object to be halted, but is otherwise
     * ignored.
